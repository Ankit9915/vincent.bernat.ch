All my projects are hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/vincentbernat). Here are a few of them:

# lldpd

*[lldpd][1]* is a [802.1AB][2] daemon. It sends and receives *LLDP*
frames which enables remote L2 equipments to determine which equipment
is remotely present. These frames contain information like the
equipment name, the port name, VLAN, etc. This daemon features SNMP
support and also supports additional protocols like [CDP][3], SONMP
and EDP.

Here is an example of output:

    Interface: tun-cisco
     ChassisID: ciscotest (local)
     SysName:   ciscotest
     SysDescr:  
       cisco 7206VXR running on
       Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software 
       IOS (tm) 7200 Software (C7200-P-M), Version 12.2(46), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

# Dashkiosk

*[Dashkiosk][4]* is a solution to manage dashboards on multiple
 screens. There are four components:

 - the server which will manage the screens by sending them what they
   should display; the server also provides an administration
   interface,
 - the receiver running in a browser and connecting to the server to
   know which dashboard should be displayed,
 - an Android application running the receiver,
 - a Chromecast application running the receiver.

For a demo, have a look at the following video:

# Snimpy

*[Snimpy][6]* is a Python tool targeted at writting simple tools using
SNMP queries. It features a very pythonic interface and any Python
developer should feel at home with it. Here is a use example:

    ::python
    load("IP-FORWARD-MIB")
    m=M()

    print "Using IP-FORWARD-MIB::ipCidrRouteTable..."
    routes = m.ipCidrRouteNextHop
    for x in routes:
         net, netmask, tos, src = x
         print "%15s/%-15s via %-15s src %-15s" % (net, netmask, routes[x], src)

Have a look at "[Snimpy: SNMP & Python][]" for more details.
