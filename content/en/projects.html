All my projects are hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/vincentbernat). Here is a few of them:

 * [lldpd][1] is a [802.1AB][2] daemon. It sends and receives LLDP
   frames which enables remote L2 equipments to determine which
   equipment is remotely present. Those frames contain information
   like the equipment name, the portname, VLAN, etc. This daemon
   features SNMP support and also supports additional protocols like
   [CDP][3], SONMP and EDP.
 * [wiremaps][4] is a web application similar to [NetDisco][5]. Its
   main aim is to answer questions about your network like “where is
   this machine plugged in my datacenter” or “what equipment is
   plugged on the port 10 of this switch”. Various bit of information
   are retrieved using SNMP such as LLDP, FDB and ARP databases.
 * [snimpy][6] is a Python tool targeted at writting simple tool using
   SNMP queries. It features a very pythonic interface. Any Python
   developer should feel at home with it. Here is a use example:

        #!python
        load("IP-FORWARD-MIB")
        m=M()

        print "Using IP-FORWARD-MIB::ipCidrRouteTable..."
        routes = m.ipCidrRouteNextHop
        for x in routes:
             net, netmask, tos, src = x
             print "%15s/%-15s via %-15s src %-15s" % (net, netmask, routes[x], src)

 * *[udpproxy][7]* allows to tunnel *UDP* datagrams into a SSH tunnel
   with the help of `NFQUEUE` target from Netfilter. This enables easy
   selection of flow to be tunneled.
