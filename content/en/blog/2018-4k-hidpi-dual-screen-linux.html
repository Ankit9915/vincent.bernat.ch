title: "HiDPI on dual 4K monitors with Linux"
description: |
  I have bought a pair of HiDPI Dell P2415Q monitors for my
  workstation. Support in Linux with X11 is still not satisfactory.

I have been using a [Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon][] laptop (210 DPI) for
four years and a [Nokia 8][] phone (550 DPI) for a year. I enjoy their
HiDPI screens: text is crisp and easy to read. To get a similar
experience for my workstation, I bought a pair of [Dell P2415Q][]
monitors:

![Two Dell P2415Q]([[!!images/dual-dell-p2415q@2x.jpg]] "Dual screen setup with two Dell P2415Q monitors")

# Monitors

The *Dell P2415Q* is a 24" display featuring an IPS panel with a
3840×2160 resolution (185 DPI) and a complete coverage of the sRGB
color space. It was released in 2015 and its price is now below $400.
It received [positive reviews][].

One of my units arrived with a dead pixel. I thought it was a problem
from the past but [Dell policy on dead pixels][] says:

> During LCD manufacturing process, it is not uncommon for one or more
> sub-pixels to become fixed in an unchanging state. A display with a
> 1 to 5 fixed sub-pixel is considered normal and within industry
> standards.

!!! "Update (2018.12)" Three new dead pixels have appeared. Therefore,
I definitely do not recommend these screens.

Another issue is the presence of faint horizontal grey lines, (barely)
visible on white background. The issue seems to [not be uncommon][]
but Dell is dismissive about it. If I sit correctly, the lines become
invisible.

I am a bit disappointed by these issues, but I think they are bearable
and it is an opportunity to help fix my obsession over such details.

# Graphic card

To drive a 4K display at 60 Hz, you need at least either [HDMI 2.0][]
or [DisplayPort 1.2][]. The *Dell P2415Q* has been [upgraded to HDMI
2.0][] in 2016 and also provides a DP 1.2 input. There is a port for
daisy-chaining a second monitor but, without support for DP 1.3, the
refresh rate would drop to 30 Hz.

There is currently no available Radeon card around $100 able to drive
two 4K displays. On the Nvidia side, the [GeForce GT 1030][] fits the
bill with a power consumption of 20 W for the GDDR4 version. I opted
for a [passively cooled model from MSI][]. On Linux, the result is
quite disappointing:

 - The [nouveau driver][] has still [rudimentary support][] for the
   this generation of Nvidia chips. The result was unbearably slow and
   the HDMI 2.0 port was not handled correctly.

 - The [proprietary Nvidia driver version 390][] exhibits [important
   performance issues][] making it unusable at these resolutions. When
   using [version 396][], the situation improves but it's still quite
   laggy. I am using [Compton][] as a compositor and I spent [a lot of
   time][] trying to get better performance using the OpenGL backend,
   without any luck. I am now using the *XRender* backend. I also have
   to enable [OpenGL compositing][] in Firefox.[^video] <del>I didn't
   test version 410 yet.</del>

!!! "Update (2018.12)" With version 410 and Linux 4.19, the
performance is slightly improved but suspend-to-RAM is broken.

[^video]: Without this setting, it's impossible to play an HD or a 4K
    video in Firefox. This is a bit a pity we are still [unable to get
    accelerated video rendering on Linux][] while other platforms have
    this feature since a long time. For Chromium, [patches exist][]
    but are left unapplied.

In the future, I may replace this card with a Radeon one. While this
may or may not improve performance,[^perf] the `amdgpu` driver should
be more stable and usable.

[^perf]: Compared to my previous setup, the number of pixels is
    quadrupled. The card is using 4-lane links over PCI 3.0 which
    translates to a bandwidth of 25 Gbits/s. This barely allows the
    transfer of 7680×2160 pixels at 60 Hz using 24-bit colors. This
    may explain the difficulty to render unaccelerated 4K videos.

# HiDPI support on Linux with X11

Gnome and KDE now supports HiDPI displays out of the box when running
with X11. For other environments, it's quite easy to setup, thanks to
[xsettingsd][]. The following snippet should be invoked from
`~/.xsession` or when the DPI value changes:

    ::shell
    # Target DPI
    dpi=192

    # For applications supporting XSettings, `Xft/DPI' sets font scaling
    # (and sometimes interface scaling), `Gdk/WindowScalingFactor' sets
    # interface scaling with GTK 3, and `Gdk/UnscaledDPI' undo font scaling
    # for GTK 3 applications.
    > ~/.xsettingsd cat <<EOF
    Xft/DPI $(( $dpi*1024 ))
    Gdk/WindowScalingFactor $(( $dpi/96 ))
    Gdk/UnscaledDPI $(( $dpi*1024/($dpi/96) ))
    EOF
    pkill -HUP xsettingsd || xsettingsd &

    # For QT applications.
    export QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=1

    # For miscellaneous applications.
    echo Xft.dpi: $dpi | xrdb -merge

Then, it is up to each application to know how to render on a HiDPI
display. The table below gives an overview of HiDPI support for
various ones, using the above settings. "*Text scaling*" indicates if
an application is able to adapt the font size. This is usually the
most essential feature. "*Interface scaling*" tells if it is able to
scale the whole interface, including the icons. Ideally, applications
are also expected to be able to dynamically update scaling when
notified through *XSettings*, which is useful when switching to an
external display.

Application                   | Text scaling | Interface scaling | No restart needed?

[^chromium]: To detect changes, *Chromium* watches for *RandR* events.
    They may be caught before *XSettings* variables are updated.

[^electron]: If it doesn't work, try with the
    `--force-device-scale-factor=2` flag.

[^blender]: *Blender* relies on the `Xft.dpi` resource value.

[^java]: Java applications need to be invoked with the `GDK_SCALE=2`
    environment variable. Otherwise, they don't scale.

**QT 5** applications offer very good support. **GTK 3**
applications can currenly only scale their interfaces using an integer
factor, which is annoying when you need an 1.5× factor. **GTK 2**
applications will only scale the text and there are still many of
them—notably *Gimp*. For more details, have a look at the dedicated
page on [ArchWiki][]. Beyond X11, [Wayland][] is able to provide
per-monitor scaling and to scale applications without HiDPI support.

In conclusion, today's situation still depends heavily on the
applications you run. As I spend most of my time in a VTE terminal, in
Emacs and in Firefox, I am mostly happy with the result.
