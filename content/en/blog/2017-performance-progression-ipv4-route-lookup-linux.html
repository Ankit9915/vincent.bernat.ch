**TL;DR**: Each of Linux 2.6.39, 3.6 and 4.0 brings notable
performance improvements for the IPv4 route lookup process.

---

In a [previous article][IPv4 route lookup on Linux], I explained how
Linux implements an IPv4 routing table with compressed tries to offer
excellent lookup times. The following graph shows the performance
progression of Linux through history:

![IPv4 route lookup performance][i3]
[i3]: [[!!images/linux/lpc-trie-perf-v2.svg]] "Route lookup times for various Linux kernel versions. Lookup is done on a table with 500,000 routes. Notable performance improvements are highlighted."

Two scenarios are tested:

 - 500,000 routes extracted from an Internet router (half of them are
   /24), and
 - 500,000 host routes (/32) tightly packed in 4 distinct subnets.

All kernels are compiled with *GCC* 4.9 (from *Debian Jessie*). This
version is able to compile older kernels[^old] as well as current
ones. The kernel configuration used is the default one with
`CONFIG_SMP` and `CONFIG_IP_MULTIPLE_TABLES` options enabled (however,
no IP rules are used). Some other unrelated options are enabled to be
able to boot them in a virtual machine and run the benchmark.

[^old]: Compiling old kernels with an updated userland may
    still require some [small][p2] [patches][p3].

The measurements are done in a virtual machine with one
vCPU[^smp]. The host is an [Intel Core i5-4670K][] and the CPU
governor was set to "performance". The benchmark is
single-threaded. Implemented as a [kernel module][], it calls
`fib_lookup()` with various destinations in 100,000 timed iterations
and keeps the median. Timings of individual runs are computed from the
TSC (and converted to nanoseconds by assuming a constant clock).

[^smp]: The kernels are compiled with the `CONFIG_SMP` option to use
    the [hierarchical RCU][] and activate more of the same code paths
    as actual routers. However, progress on parallelism are left
    unnoticed.

The following kernel versions bring a notable performance improvement:

 - In Linux **2.6.39**, [commit 3630b7c050d9][], David Miller removes
   the hash-based routing table implementation to switch to the
   LPC-trie implementation (available since Linux 2.6.13 as a
   compile-time option). This brings a small regression for the
   scenario with many host routes but boosts the performance for the
   general case.

 - In Linux **3.0**, [commit 281dc5c5ec0f][], the improvement is not
   related to the network subsystem. Linus Torvalds disables the
   compiler size-optimization from the default configuration. It was
   believed that optimizing for size would help keeping the
   instruction cache efficient. However, compilers generated
   under-performing code on x86 when this option was enabled.

 - In Linux **3.6**, [commit f4530fa574df][], David Miller adds an
   optimization to not evaluate IP rules when they are left
   unconfigured. From this point, the use of the
   `CONFIG_IP_MULTIPLE_TABLES` option doesn't impact the performances
   unless some IP rules are configured. This version also removes
   the [route cache][] ([commit 5e9965c15ba8][]). However, this has no
   effect on the benchmark as it directly calls `fib_lookup()` which
   doesn't involve the cache.

 - In Linux **4.0**, notably [commit 9f9e636d4f89][], Alexander Duyck
   adds several optimizations to the trie lookup algorithm. It really
   pays off!

 - In Linux **4.1**, [commit 0ddcf43d5d4a][], Alexander Duyck
   collapses the local and main tables when no specific IP rules are
   configured. For non-local traffic, both those tables were looked
   up.

**UPDATED (2017.11):** Here is a graph for more recent
kernels. Measures were performed into similar conditions. Performances
decline a bit since 4.11.
